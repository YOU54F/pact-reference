# Pact Reference Implementation
> Reference implementations for Pact Specification written in Rust

This project contains a reference implementation of the [Pact specifications](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification)
written in Rust, as well as example projects in JavaScript and C (and a few others) that use the mock server library.

## Usage

### Rust

For Rust projects, you can use the Rust crates from this library in your project directly. Refer to the [Rust project
readme](rust/README.md). Requires minimum Rust 1.71.0.

### Other languages

This project contains dynamic libraries that expose the core functionality through FFI (Foreign Function Interface).

For examples:
* [Javascript](javascript)
* [C](c/consumer-verification)
* [Ruby](ruby/example_consumer_spec)
* [PHP](php)

## Building

To build the libraries in this project, you need a working Rust environment.  Requires minimum Rust 1.59.0.
Refer to the [Rust Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

The build tool used is `cargo`.

```shell
cd rust
cargo build
```

This will compile all the libraries and put the generated files in `rust/target/debug`.
